            <h6 class="card-title">Fooridise can assist you in choosing where you want to grab your next bite: whether it may be something you never tried, or a certain cuisine that you are in the mood for. With Fooridise, you have the option of doing contactless delivery or  take-out.
                Restaurants are currently under strict regulations in each individual state and this may affect your experience while obtaining a meal since hours and menus are constantly changing with these protocols. With our application, COVID-19 restrictions and hours are updated consistently in order to keep you informed of the ever-changing times and restrictions being set in place.
                Our users and their safety are at the center of our interface, making it extremely easy and safe for anyone to browse, select, register and place your order. We want to protect you and the drivers as much as possible by making our process seamless and minimize the number of hands that your food goes through.
